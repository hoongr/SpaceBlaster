# Space Blaster

A simple version of the game Astro-Blaster. 

This was a project for a class assignment. The sound effects, graphic pictures, and SpriteManager.h were all provided.

I was responsible for the following files:
* Actor.h 
* Actor.cpp 
* StudentWorld.h 
* StudentWorld.cpp 

These four files contained all of the game object logic including movement, enemy action, collissions, etc.

## Usage and Rules

1. You are the player ship on the left. 
2. Move with the arrow keys and shoot the blaster with the space bar, which fires cabbage
projectiles. 
3. You can also acquire torpedoes, which are sporadically dropped by some alien ships and do more damage than their
cabbage counterparts. 
4. They can be fired with the tab button. There are three types of alien ships, all with different amounts 
of health-points and damage: the Smallgons, Smoregons, and Snagglegons. 
5. You have a maximum of 3 lives.
6. Extra lives can be obtained by grabbing the Goodie bag that is sometimes dropped by the aliens. 
7. As you progress through each level, there are more and more aliens to defeat. 
8. To progress to the next level, you must destroy every alien on that level.
